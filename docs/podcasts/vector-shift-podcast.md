# **Podcast Transcript: Vector Shift – Interview with Brendan Foody, Founder of Mercor**  

**Host:** Welcome to the *Vector Shift* podcast! *Vector Shift* is an AI automation platform, and on this podcast, we have conversations with founders and experts in fields such as AI and B2B SaaS.  

Before we dive in, we’d like to give a brief introduction to our guest. **Brendan Foody** is the **CEO and founder of Mercor**, an AI-powered platform that **sources, vets, and pays employees**.  

Just as a side note, we at *Vector Shift* are **very happy customers of Mercor**. They’ve been **an essential partner** in our hiring—especially for contractors and even full-time employees—delivering **A+ engineering talent** to our team.  

In today’s episode, we’re going to cover three main topics:  
1. **The founding story of Brendan and Mercor.**  
2. **What makes their product unique and differentiated.**  
3. **Mercor’s go-to-market strategy and Brendan’s thoughts on the startup ecosystem.**  

Brendan, thanks for joining us! Let’s start with your background—how did you get to where you are today?

## **Mercor’s Founding Story**  
**Brendan:** First of all, I really appreciate the glowing review and the opportunity to be on the podcast. The sentiment is definitely mutual!  

To give some background, my co-founders **Adar Siri, Sera**, and I have known each other for a long time—we went to high school together and were **always building companies** in one form or another. We launched various web apps, one of which scaled to **six figures in revenue while we were still in high school**.  

I never really wanted to go to college, but the hardest and most **important part of building any company** was **hiring the right people**. It was **painfully inefficient** and outdated. So, we became obsessed with fixing this process.  

We launched **Mercor** with the goal of making hiring **100x better**—streamlining the way people **find, evaluate, and hire talent from around the world**.

## **What’s Broken in Hiring Today?**  
**Host:** That makes a lot of sense. Hiring is always on my mind as a founder. Can you go deeper into what’s broken in hiring today?  

**Brendan:** Absolutely. The way hiring works today is **fundamentally a services business**, bound by **manual human processes**.  

- Companies pay **huge fees** to recruiters or staffing agencies, who take a **percentage of salaries**.  
- These businesses **charge massive margins** and don’t scale well because **they rely on people**, not technology.  

At **Mercor**, we **automate all of these traditionally human processes** with **AI-driven infrastructure**. This allows us to:  
- **Vet and evaluate talent at scale.**  
- **Surface the best candidates from around the world.**  
- **Drastically reduce costs and hiring times.**  

We’re already seeing **massive adoption**, with **hundreds of thousands of candidates onboarded worldwide**. Just this week, we added **over a million new talent profiles** by evaluating **GitHub contributions and online data** using AI.

## **How is Mercor Different from Other Hiring Platforms?**  
**Host:** There are a lot of HR tech startups out there. What makes Mercor different?  

**Brendan:** Great question. The problem with the industry today is **fragmentation**—companies use **multiple disjointed tools** for hiring:  

- **LinkedIn** for sourcing candidates.  
- **Apollo or ZoomInfo** for data enrichment.  
- **Applicant tracking systems (ATS) like Greenhouse** to manage applications.  
- **Calendly for scheduling interviews.**  
- **Recruiters or manual processes** for final evaluations.  

At **Mercor**, we take a **Rippling-style approach**: **instead of 10 different tools, we provide one unified platform** that solves the entire hiring process.  

For example, on the **Mercor dashboard**, you can:  
- **Describe the role** you’re hiring for.  
- **Instantly see pre-vetted candidates** who match your needs.  
- **Review AI-powered interviews and GitHub analysis** for each candidate.  
- **Hire and onboard seamlessly**—with compliance and payments built in.

## **The Applicant Experience: AI-Powered Vetting and Interviews**  
**Host:** That sounds like a seamless process. Can you walk us through the experience for applicants?  

**Brendan:** Of course! **Unlike other platforms that focus only on employers, we prioritize applicants first.**  

The **applicant journey** is designed to be **simple yet powerful**:  
1. **Upload your résumé** – It’s parsed and evaluated by a **multimodal language model** (GPT-4, fine-tuned for hiring).  
2. **AI Interview** – Applicants **select their skills and preferred roles**, then **schedule an interview** with our AI recruiter, **John Sharma**.  
3. **Deep Context Interviews** – The AI interviewer **analyzes past projects, GitHub repositories, and personal websites** and asks detailed questions about **system architecture, design choices, and experience.**  
4. **Salary & Availability Submission** – Candidates submit their **compensation expectations and availability**, ensuring that employers see **only active, available candidates**.  

Right now, we conduct **one AI interview per candidate**, but as we scale, we’ll likely introduce **multiple rounds** to identify **the absolute best talent for each role.**

## **The Secret Sauce: How Mercor Finds Rockstar Candidates**  
**Host:** I’ve been super impressed with the engineers you’ve found for us. What’s your secret?  

**Brendan:** It all comes down to **scalable AI-driven vetting**—especially for **international candidates, where talent density varies dramatically**.  

If you're hiring **Stanford AI PhDs**, your hit rate is naturally high. But if you're searching for **hidden talent in a remote part of India**, the challenge is **filtering through thousands of applicants** to find **the few that are exceptional**.  

Our **AI-driven process** enables us to:  
- **Analyze open-source contributions** on GitHub.  
- **Conduct detailed AI interviews** at scale.  
- **Identify high-potential candidates that others overlook**—those without Google or Stanford on their résumé.  

By using **software instead of people**, we **dramatically expand access to opportunities** while ensuring **companies get top-tier talent**.

## **The Employer Experience: How Companies Use Mercor**  
**Host:** We’re familiar with the employer side, but for new listeners—how does hiring work on Mercor?  

**Brendan:** The **employer experience is built for speed and efficiency**.  

1. **Instant Access to Candidates** – Employers type in a query and instantly see **pre-vetted talent profiles**.  
2. **AI-Powered Search** – Our **semantic search engine** continuously improves, ranking candidates based on **technical skills, experience, and interview performance.**  
3. **Flexible Hiring Options** – Employers can:  
   - **Request an interview.**  
   - **Watch a recording of the AI interview.**  
   - **Hire immediately for a trial period.**  

Some of our customers now **skip interviews entirely** and **onboard candidates directly** based on our AI vetting.

## **Challenges of Building a Compound Startup**  
**Host:** You’re building an ambitious, vertically integrated product. What’s been the hardest part?  

**Brendan:** **Building a compound startup is incredibly complex** because we have to develop multiple deep-tech solutions at once:  

- **AI résumé parsing & evaluation** – A startup on its own.  
- **AI interviews** – A separate AI-powered SaaS product.  
- **AI-driven search & hiring infrastructure** – Yet another standalone company.  
- **Payments & compliance** – A massive fintech problem.  

Executing **all of this in parallel** is challenging, but we’ve succeeded thanks to our **India-based engineering team**, who have been **critical to scaling quickly and cost-effectively**.

## **Growth and Go-to-Market Strategy for 2024**  
**Host:** How did you get your first customers, and what’s next?  

**Brendan:**  
- We **started with early-stage founders**, just like us, who needed cost-effective engineers.  
- **Referrals** drove our initial growth, scaling us to **seven figures in revenue before raising capital**.  
- **For 2024**, we’re expanding into:  
  - **Enterprise contracts** (e.g., Salesforce hiring thousands of engineers).  
  - **AI-driven content marketing** (e.g., auto-generating thousands of hiring guides).

## **Final Question: Vision vs. Execution**  
**Host:** In Silicon Valley, there’s a big debate: What matters more—**vision or execution?**  

**Brendan:** **Execution is underrated.** Ideas **multiply** execution, but at the end of the day, **hard work and iteration** make the difference.

**Host:** Brendan, thanks for an amazing conversation!  

**Brendan:** Thanks for having me! Looking forward to doing this again.
