# **Podcast Transcript: 1 to 100 – Interview with Brendan Foody, Founder of Mercor**  

**Host:** Hello, and welcome to *1 to 100*, a podcast that takes you inside the most promising hypergrowth startups through conversations with their founders. At *1 to 100*, our goal is to give you the inside story alongside empirical analysis of notable tech companies that you might want to join.  

I'm your host, **Aswan Hanif**, the author of *The Why You Should Join* newsletter. For those tuning in, welcome to *1 to 100*, where every week we sit down with the founders of some of the most notable hypergrowth startups.  

Today’s company, **Mercor**, is an AI-powered platform that **sources, vets, and pays employees**. They’ve gone from **zero to mid-seven figures in revenue in just one year** and work with top foundation model and AI companies. We’re super excited to be chatting with **Brendan Foody, the company’s founder and CEO**.  

**Host:** Brendan, thank you so much for doing this.

### **What is Mercor and Why Are Companies Using It?**  
**Host:** Awesome. Well, to start, you guys have gone from **zero to mid-seven figures in revenue in a year**—clearly, you have something that people want. For listeners unfamiliar with Mercor, could you explain what you’ve built that companies are eager to use?  

**Brendan:** Sure. A basic way to think about Mercor is that there’s a **huge industry around staffing** where people manually review résumés, conduct interviews, and match candidates with jobs. Mercor **builds and trains models that automate all of those processes**.  

- We **review résumés** just like a human recruiter would.  
- We **conduct AI-powered interviews** that are even more in-depth than human-led interviews.  
- Most importantly, we **facilitate job matching** with large-scale models that predict **which candidates are most likely to succeed** in a given job.  

Many of our clients hire **high volumes of expert contractors** to build **human data teams**, and they leverage our infrastructure to **find the best experts in the world** at scale.

### **How Does Mercor Work?**  
**Host:** That makes sense. Can you walk us through what the experience looks like for a candidate and an employer?  

**Brendan:** Of course.  

For candidates:  
- They can **upload their résumé** at [work.mercor.com](https://work.mercor.com).  
- They **join an interview** where an AI interviewer asks them questions about their past projects and work experience.  
- They **receive feedback** and, if they qualify, get matched with relevant job opportunities.  

For employers:  
- They go to [team.mercor.com](https://team.mercor.com).  
- They **search for any role** they need to fill using our AI-powered system.  
- Our system recommends **the best candidates from our talent pool** of over **300,000 vetted applicants**.

### **How is Mercor Different from Competitors Like Toptal and Turing?**  
**Host:** What makes Mercor better than other hiring platforms? Is it speed, quality, user experience? You’ve got some big customers—why are they choosing you?  

**Brendan:** The key dimensions that customers care about are:  
1. **Speed** – We can identify the right candidates almost instantly.  
2. **Quality** – We surface **more relevant and highly skilled candidates**.  
3. **Cost** – Our automated approach makes hiring **significantly cheaper**.  

When hiring a remote software engineer, companies might spend **weeks conducting interviews** and still end up with an imperfect hire. With Mercor, they can assess and interview **hundreds of thousands of people at the cost of software**, finding **better candidates faster and at lower costs** than traditional hiring.  

As for competitors like **Toptal and Turing**, here’s how we differ:  

- **Toptal** started as an **arbitrage on Eastern European developers**, manually vetting and placing engineers with companies. However, their **fee structure is insanely high—often 40% or more**. We take **Toptal’s high-quality approach but automate it**, reducing costs and improving efficiency.  
- **Turing** wanted to automate hiring in the late 2010s, but **LLMs (large language models) weren’t powerful enough at the time**. They ended up building a **mostly manual business** with heavy AI marketing. Now that LLMs are advanced, we’re fulfilling **Turing’s original vision—but actually automated**.

### **The Technology Behind Mercor’s AI Hiring Platform**  
**Host:** Let’s talk about the tech. Your AI **interviews candidates, analyzes résumés, and even predicts job performance**. How did you build this?  

**Brendan:** It’s an incredibly hard problem because **even humans struggle with predicting job performance**. Here’s how we approach it:  

- **AI Interviewer:** This requires **pre-processing** to ensure a seamless experience and **agentic behavior** during the interview to adjust questions dynamically.  
- **Matching Algorithm:** We assess candidates on **two key dimensions**:  
  1. **Relevance** – How well does their background match the job?  
  2. **Excellence** – How skilled and competent are they?  
- **Fine-tuning models:** We use **proprietary data** to fine-tune our models, learning from every interaction.  

We’ve also started **incorporating audio and video analysis**—for example, MIT research shows that **heart rate can be estimated from video interviews**, providing subtle clues about a candidate’s confidence and engagement.

### **Defensibility and Mercor’s Competitive Edge**  
**Host:** A lot of companies claim to be “AI-powered.” How do you convince customers that Mercor is the real deal?  

**Brendan:** Instead of just **saying** we use AI, we **show** customers:  
- **They can watch AI-conducted interview recordings.**  
- **They see detailed résumés analyzed by our models.**  
- **They get summaries explaining why we selected each candidate.**  

This transparency builds trust and proves that we’re actually automating hiring—unlike many AI-branded competitors that still rely on manual processes.

### **Hiring at Mercor**

- **11 full-time employees in the U.S.**  
- **20+ contractors, mostly engineers in India**  
- We’re **hiring full-stack engineers, ML engineers, and operations roles**. If you’re interested, **email me at brendan@mercor.com**!
