# **Podcast Transcript: Interview with Brendan Foody, Founder of Mercor**  

**Host:** Brendan, thanks for taking the time to join the podcast today. I really appreciate it. You’re the **founder and CEO of Mercor**, and you and your co-founders recently made it into the **Thiel Fellowship**—congrats on that! Also, congratulations on starting the company, raising your first round of funding, and all the exciting momentum.  

I’m really interested in what you’re building at **Mercor**—a platform that leverages **AI to evaluate and match global talent with elite companies** around the world. I’m excited to dive into that, but before we get into the details, can you start by sharing your **origin story**? Feel free to go back as early as you’d like and walk us through the key decisions that led you to where you are today.

## **Brendan Foody’s Entrepreneurial Journey**  
**Brendan:** Yeah, absolutely!  

I’ve **always been an entrepreneur**—I loved building things from a young age. Even back in **elementary school**, I was starting small businesses.  

One of my first ventures was in **eighth grade**, where I ran a **donut stand**. I hired my friends, bought **Safeway donuts**, and resold them outside my middle school at a **4x markup**. I made **thousands of dollars** at 13 years old and realized that this was something I genuinely loved doing.  

In **high school**, I scaled a business to a **six-figure revenue run rate** doing **AWS consulting**. I helped startups find **AWS cloud promotions** they were eligible for but hadn’t applied for. There was a program called **AWS Activate**, which provided **$5,000 in free credits**, but many startups weren’t taking advantage of it.  

So, I would go to them and **offer to consult**, helping them secure the credits. I charged them **$1,000** in exchange for getting **$5,000 in AWS credits**—a no-brainer deal for them, and an easy cash flow business for me.  

During this time, I met my **co-founders, Adar and Sera**. We all went to **high school together in San Jose** and had known each other since we were 14. They were the **winningest debate team of all time**, but I’m **dyslexic**, so I wasn’t much of a debater. Instead, I was the guy **building things behind the scenes**.  

In **college**, I was roommates with **Sera** at **Georgetown**, while **Adar was at Harvard**. We kept **working together remotely**, and when it came time to **start a company**, they were the **best people I could imagine doing it with**.  

We officially started **Mercor in January 2023**, and it’s been a **wild ride** ever since—**dropping out of college, getting the Thiel Fellowship, securing funding, and scaling quickly.**

## **Dropping Out of College to Build Mercor**  
**Host:** So you all started Mercor while still in college. How did you decide that this was the idea worth dropping out for?  

**Brendan:** Yeah, great question.  

We had been **thinking about this idea since high school**. After our **senior year graduation trip**, we talked a lot about **the inefficiencies in hiring**—especially in **global talent markets**.  

I was **building AWS tools** and needed **developers to help me**. I worked with **incredible engineers from India**—many from **IITs**—who were **amazing but overlooked** in the hiring process.  

We launched **a dev shop** to **build projects for startups**, and **friends kept asking us** to help **find and hire engineers for them directly**. That was the **moment we realized** there was **a bigger opportunity**—helping companies find **high-caliber global talent** in a **scalable, AI-driven way**.

## **Making the Decision to Drop Out**  
**Host:** Was dropping out of college an easy decision for you?  

**Brendan:** It was very different for all of us.  

For me, **I never wanted to go to college in the first place**. I actually **refused to apply to schools**, which drove my parents crazy. When I eventually did drop out, **I didn’t even tell them**—which, as you can imagine, didn’t go over well.  

For **Adar and Sera**, it was a bit different. They **officially went on leave** in August 2023, while I had already **stopped attending classes** partway through my sophomore year.  

**Host:** Are things cool with your parents now?  

**Brendan:** Yeah, everything’s good now! They were always **supportive deep down**, but obviously, dropping out isn’t an easy thing for parents to accept.  

Interestingly, **Sera’s parents didn’t tell their extended family in India that he dropped out**—instead, they told them he **got a $100,000 scholarship** from the **Thiel Fellowship**, which is technically true!

## **The Vision Behind Mercor**  
**Host:** Let’s talk about **Mercor’s core vision**. You mentioned labor markets and inefficiencies—can you break that down for us?  

**Brendan:** Absolutely.  

**Labor markets power the global economy.** There’s **a ton of work to be done**, and there are **people capable of doing that work**. But the **process of matching the right people to the right jobs is incredibly inefficient**.  

Right now, companies **hire full-time employees** who might be **pulled in multiple directions**, often **doing tasks they’re not great at**.  

The **problem** is **matching**—companies struggle to find the right talent, and candidates struggle to find the right roles.  

When we saw **ChatGPT** and the rapid improvement in **LLMs**, we realized we could **solve this problem at scale** by:  
1. **Collecting and analyzing massive amounts of data on human ability.**  
2. **Using AI-powered interviews to deeply understand what candidates are good at.**  
3. **Matching them to the right roles based on real performance indicators.**  

**Host:** So Mercor is essentially an **AI-driven talent marketplace**?  

**Brendan:** Exactly. **We collect, evaluate, and match global talent using AI.**

## **How Mercor Works**  
**Host:** Walk us through how **Mercor works today**.  

**Brendan:** Sure!  

1. **AI-Powered Interviews** – We have an **AI interviewer** that conducts **in-depth Zoom interviews**. It asks **detailed questions** about a candidate’s past work, skills, and **even GitHub repositories**.  
2. **Comprehensive Candidate Evaluation** – We analyze their **résumé, interview responses, GitHub projects, and more.**  
3. **Matching Candidates with the Right Roles** – Companies get **highly qualified, pre-vetted candidates instantly**, reducing **hiring time and cost.**  

One of our key **insights** is that **different roles require different evaluation criteria**.  

- For a **data scientist**, we focus on **general intelligence and problem-solving ability**.  
- For a **React developer**, we prioritize **domain expertise and practical experience**.  

We also **build custom prediction models** using performance data from our clients—some of the **biggest AI companies in Silicon Valley**.

## **The Future of Work and Task-Based Hiring**  
**Host:** Do you think the future of work is moving toward **task-based** rather than full-time jobs?  

**Brendan:** Yes, absolutely.  

We’re seeing **AI labs already hiring domain experts** to train models on **specific tasks**. Over time, we expect:  
- **More knowledge work to be automated.**  
- **Humans to focus on the highest-leverage tasks.**  
- **Work to become more fluid and project-based.**  

**Host:** So instead of full-time roles, people will be **hired for specialized tasks across multiple companies**?  

**Brendan:** Exactly. **AI will handle repetitive work, and humans will do what AI can’t—at least for now.**

## **Scaling Mercor to 100M Users**  
**Host:** You mentioned a goal of **100 million users**. How do you get there?  

**Brendan:** We’re launching **AI-driven tools** that provide **free résumé and interview feedback**, driving massive **organic adoption**.  

**Host:** And on the employer side?  

**Brendan:** We’ve already placed **thousands of engineers** and are now expanding into **enterprise hiring**—helping companies onboard talent at scale.

## **Final Thoughts: The Thiel Fellowship & The Future of Mercor**  
**Host:** Congrats again on the **Thiel Fellowship**! What has that experience been like?  

**Brendan:** It’s been amazing—**all three of our co-founders got in**, which is extremely rare. The network is **incredible**, and it’s pushing us to **build something truly transformative.**  

**Host:** Where can people go to learn more about Mercor?
