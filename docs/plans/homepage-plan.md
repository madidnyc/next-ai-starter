# Homepage Implementation Plan

## Overview
Based on the homepage copy document and the style guide, we will implement the homepage in a modular fashion. Each section will be a separate React component located in the `src/components/homepage/` folder. The parent `Homepage` component will assemble all sections.

## Folder Structure
```
src/
 └── components/
     └── homepage/
         ├── HeroSection.tsx
         ├── PainPointsSection.tsx
         ├── AIAdvantageSection.tsx
         ├── VettingSection.tsx
         ├── UseCasesSection.tsx
         ├── ExpertCategoriesSection.tsx
         ├── HowItWorksSection.tsx
         ├── SocialProofSection.tsx
         ├── FinalCTASection.tsx
         └── Homepage.tsx
```

## Component Breakdown
1. **HeroSection**: 
   - Displays headline, subhead, key metrics, dashboard mockup placeholder, and CTA buttons.
   - Uses Tailwind CSS classes as per the style guide.
2. **PainPointsSection**:
   - Implements a three-card horizontal layout with icons and descriptive text.
3. **AIAdvantageSection**:
   - Lists technical benefits with icons and a subtle background gradient.
4. **VettingSection**:
   - Outlines academic rigor with bullet points detailing the verification process.
5. **UseCasesSection**:
   - Renders a three-card layout highlighting different use cases.
6. **ExpertCategoriesSection**:
   - Uses a three-column grid to detail academic and domain talent breakdowns with a vertical Brand Green divider.
7. **HowItWorksSection**:
   - Presents a step-by-step process with circular icons and connecting arrows.
8. **SocialProofSection**:
   - Displays metrics, a testimonial, and placeholders for academic logos.
9. **FinalCTASection**:
   - A footer section with a strong call to action, incorporating a subtle wave pattern accent.

## Styling and Assets
- Apply Tailwind CSS classes as specified in the style guide.
- Use placeholders for images, icons (dashboard mockup, academic logos, etc.) with accompanying notes for asset collection.
- Ensure responsiveness using Tailwind's grid and flex utilities, following the defined breakpoints.

## Next Steps
1. Create the folder and individual component files under `src/components/homepage/`.
2. Implement each component with initial placeholder content based on the copy document.
3. Assemble the components in a parent `Homepage.tsx` component.
4. Review and adjust design details; update documentation and the memory bank with notes on missing assets.

## Notes
- Numeric metrics, testimonials, and other dynamic data will be static placeholders for now.
- Future updates can integrate dynamic data sources and finalized assets.
