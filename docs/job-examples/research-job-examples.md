# Hiring Trends and Insights
**Broad Demand for AI Domain Experts:** Mercor’s contract postings show a clear trend of AI labs seeking **subject-matter experts across disciplines** – from lawyers and doctors to chemists, educators, and software engineers – to improve AI systems. This reflects a growing industry need for **cross-disciplinary collaboration** in AI development. AI models are being trained and tested on domain-specific knowledge, so specialists in law, medicine, finance, science, etc., are engaged on a contract basis to supply expert data, feedback, and evaluation. Mercor’s ability to list roles like *Legal Intelligence Analyst*, *Medical Intelligence Analyst*, and even *Competitive Programming Tutor* side by side (~[Mercor](https://mercor.com/#:~:text=send%20your%20application%20to%20thousands,the%20best%20roles%20for%20you)~) highlights how varied these opportunities are.
**Part-Time, Remote & Flexible Work:** Nearly all these roles are remote and offer flexible, part-time hours. A common arrangement is ~10–20 hours per week with the possibility of scaling up to full-time hours if the project expands (~[Legal Intelligence Analyst - Mercor Jobs](https://mercor.com/jobs/list_AAABkrApgSH-_km1cFVOarI7/#:~:text=The%20project%20is%2010,it%20can%20be%20done)~). This indicates that companies prefer to **start with short-term contracts** to accomplish specific AI training tasks. The work is often asynchronous (no fixed schedule), enabling **worldwide talent participation**. Mercor itself emphasizes that candidates can “apply and work from anywhere in the world” (~[Mercor](https://mercor.com/#:~:text=)~), reinforcing the global scope of these contracts.
**High Compensation for Specialized Skills:** The hourly rates offered are generally **well above industry norms**, which underscores how in-demand these skills are. For example, a senior software contractor can earn $210/hour (~[Mercor](https://mercor.com/#:~:text=send%20your%20application%20to%20thousands,the%20best%20roles%20for%20you)~), and domain experts in fields like medicine and machine learning command around $100+/hour (~[Medical Intelligence Analyst - Mercor Jobs](https://mercor.com/jobs/list_AAABkrApUo3UYpv2ZN1Ihp_5/#:~:text=Mercor%20is%20seeking%20Medical%20Intelligence,This%20role%20pays%20%24130%2Fhour)~) (~[Machine Learning Researcher - Mercor Jobs](https://mercor.com/jobs/list_AAABlAkhu8MgJc6zyl9FjKFm/#:~:text=Machine%20Learning%20Researcher%20,Responsibilities%3A%20We%20are%20seeking)~). Even roles for recent graduates (e.g. CS experts) pay $30–$35/hour (~[Computer Science – StudySmarter – Talents](https://talents.studysmarter.co.uk/jobs/computer-science-622040/#:~:text=With%20respect%20to%20pay%20and,legal%20status)~), and experienced professionals in niche domains (like GIS or architecture) see rates around $90–$100/hour (~[GIS Intelligence Engineer - Mercor Jobs](https://mercor.com/jobs/list_AAABkt5--ZjdikIlqixOw5ZH/#:~:text=GIS%20Intelligence%20Engineer%20,role%20pays%20starting%20at%20%2495%2Fhour)~) (~[Architectural Intelligence Engineer - Mercor Jobs](https://mercor.com/jobs/list_AAABkt5--PJC4_5oJ5lBeZie/#:~:text=Architectural%20Intelligence%20Engineer%20,role%20pays%20starting%20at%20%2490%2Fhour)~). Mercor advertises that candidates can *“earn top 1% pay”* through its platform (~[Mercor](https://mercor.com/#:~:text=Earn%20top%201)~), which these postings corroborate.
**Short-Term Projects & Scaling Up:** Many contract roles appear tied to **specific AI projects or data-collection efforts**. In fact, a Mercor representative noted that *“most of their jobs are part-time short contracting positions to label LLM data for other companies”* (~[Beware Mercor Open Positions / Hiring : r/cscareerquestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1i6sms2/beware_mercor_open_positions_hiring/#:~:text=%E2%80%A2)~). This means hires are often brought on to perform data annotation, evaluation, or feedback tasks that directly train large language models (LLMs) and other AI systems. The nature of the work is typically short-term (“10–20 hours of work” is often mentioned), but with a pipeline for extension if the project needs more input (~[Legal Intelligence Analyst - Mercor Jobs](https://mercor.com/jobs/list_AAABkrApgSH-_km1cFVOarI7/#:~:text=The%20project%20is%2010,it%20can%20be%20done)~). This flexible project-based approach lets AI labs scale up the workforce quickly when needed. For instance, Mercor recruited **50+ coding experts and ~20 math experts** for large-scale AI training efforts (~[Competitive Programming Tutor - Mercor Jobs](https://mercor.com/jobs/list_AAABkrUouLdothyvQrlMq4ED/#:~:text=Competitive%20Programming%20Tutor.%20%2445%20,or)~) (~[Mathematics Intelligence Analyst - Mercor Jobs](https://mercor.com/jobs/list_AAABkv7MHHmJChnXEllGM4gP/#:~:text=Mercor%20is%20recruiting%20at%20least,with%20a%20leading%20AI%20lab)~) – indicating that some projects require a significant volume of expert contributions in parallel.
**No Formal Deadlines, Rolling Recruitment:** The job listings did not specify application deadlines, implying a **rolling recruitment** model. Mercor likely evaluates candidates continuously using its AI interview process and matches them to these contract roles as long as the projects are active. This agile hiring approach aligns with the fast-paced needs of AI research labs.
**Platform Growth and Impact:** Mercor’s model of vetting candidates with AI and placing them in contract roles has gained traction. The company recently raised substantial funding (e.g. $32M in a Series A) and reached valuations around $250M (~[AI Recruiting Startup Mercor Rockets to $2 Billion Valuation - WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ai-recruiting-startup-mercor-rockets-to-2-billion-valuation-9698dbdc#:~:text=AI%20Recruiting%20Startup%20Mercor%20Rockets,million%20a%20few%20months%20ago)~), underscoring the demand for its services. The success suggests a broader **hiring trend toward contract-based expert involvement** in AI development, rather than traditional full-time hires, especially for highly specialized or temporary needs. Companies can rapidly tap into a global talent pool of PhDs, domain professionals, and top-tier engineers to advance their AI projects.
In summary, Mercor’s contract job postings reveal an emerging hiring pattern in the AI industry: **assemble a diverse team of part-time experts on-demand to tackle specific training tasks for AI models**. This provides AI organizations with flexibility and access to specialized knowledge, while offering professionals around the world high-paying, flexible gigs in their field of expertise. As AI projects continue to proliferate across domains, such contract opportunities are likely to remain a key hiring strategy, bridging the gap between cutting-edge tech and domain-specific human insight (~[Beware Mercor Open Positions / Hiring : r/cscareerquestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1i6sms2/beware_mercor_open_positions_hiring/#:~:text=%E2%80%A2)~) (~[AI Recruiting Startup Mercor Rockets to $2 Billion Valuation - WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ai-recruiting-startup-mercor-rockets-to-2-billion-valuation-9698dbdc#:~:text=AI%20Recruiting%20Startup%20Mercor%20Rockets,million%20a%20few%20months%20ago)~).
