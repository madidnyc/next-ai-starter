## Project Setup Tasks Checklist

Below is the checklist for setting up the project directory as per the analysis and project-level guidelines:

1. **Unified Next.js Application Verification**
- [x] Confirm the existence of essential files (package.json, tsconfig.json, tailwind.config.ts, etc.).

2. **Organize the Application Directory (src/app/)**
- [x] Verify that the "src/app/" folder exists.
- [x] Create the "src/app/marketing/" folder for marketing-specific pages.
- [x] Create the "src/app/app/" folder to house all future app-related pages and features.
- [x] Ensure the "src/app/api/" folder exists for API routes.

3. **Setup Shared Resources**
- [x] Confirm the existence of the "src/components/" folder for shared UI components.
- [x] Confirm the existence of the "src/lib/" folder for utilities and shared TypeScript types.
- [x] **Optional:** Modularize the "src/lib/" directory by creating subdirectories such as "src/lib/utils/" for general utilities and "src/lib/api/" for API-related logic. (SKIPPED - will revisit during full app phase to avoid breaking existing imports)
- [x] Create a "src/styles/" folder if additional modular styling is required.

4. **Configure Dummy Data**
- [x] Create a root-level "data/mock/" directory.
- [x] Populate "data/mock/" with static JSON files for dummy "Search Talent" and "Search Open Jobs" data.

5. **Establish Testing Structure**
- [x] Create a top-level "tests/unit/" directory for Jest unit tests.
- [x] Create a top-level "tests/integration/" directory for Jest integration tests.
- [x] Create a top-level "tests/e2e/" directory for Playwright end-to-end tests.

6. **Documentation Review and Update**
- [x] Update "functional_specifications.md" with the new project structure and technical implementation details.
- [x] Maintain separation of concerns in documentation:
  - projectBrief.md: Business overview and planning
  - functional_specifications.md: Technical implementation details

7. **Validate Build and Git Workflow**
- [x] Run `npm run build` to ensure the project builds successfully.
- [x] Follow Git guidelines by committing changes with proper commit messages.

8. **Organize Static Assets in the Public Folder**
- [x] Create subfolders such as "public/assets/" and "public/images/" to organize images, fonts, and icons.

All tasks have been completed successfully. The project structure is now ready for the marketing site phase implementation, with clear documentation separation between business overview (projectBrief.md) and technical details (functional_specifications.md). Future app features will be properly organized under src/app/app/.
