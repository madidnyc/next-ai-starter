## Project Setup Tasks Checklist

Below is the checklist for setting up the project directory as per the analysis and project-level guidelines:

1. **Unified Next.js Application Verification**
- [x] Confirm the existence of essential files (package.json, tsconfig.json, tailwind.config.ts, etc.).

2. **Organize the Application Directory (src/app/)**
- [x] Verify that the "src/app/" folder exists.
- [x] Create the "src/app/marketing/" folder for marketing-specific pages.
- [x] Create the "src/app/app/" (or "src/app/dashboard/") folder reserved for future core app pages.
- [x] Ensure the "src/app/api/" folder exists for API routes.

3. **Setup Shared Resources**
- [x] Confirm the existence of the "src/components/" folder for shared UI components.
- [x] Confirm the existence of the "src/lib/" folder for utilities and shared TypeScript types.
- [x] **Optional:** Modularize the "src/lib/" directory by creating subdirectories such as "src/lib/utils/" for general utilities and "src/lib/api/" for API-related logic. (SKIPPED - will revisit during full app phase to avoid breaking existing imports)
- [x] Create a "src/styles/" folder if additional modular styling is required.

4. **Configure Dummy Data**
- [x] Create a root-level "data/mock/" directory.
- [x] Populate "data/mock/" with static JSON files for dummy "Search Talent" and "Search Open Jobs" data.

5. **Establish Testing Structure**
- [x] Create a top-level "tests/unit/" directory for Jest unit tests.
- [x] Create a top-level "tests/integration/" directory for Jest integration tests.
- [x] Create a top-level "tests/e2e/" directory for Playwright end-to-end tests.

6. **Documentation Review and Update**
- [x] Update "functional_specifications.md" with the new project structure and technical implementation details.
- [x] Keep "projectBrief.md" focused on high-level project overview and business requirements.

7. **Validate Build and Git Workflow**
- [ ] Run `npm run build` to ensure the project builds successfully.
- [ ] Follow Git guidelines by committing changes with proper commit messages.

8. **Organize Static Assets in the Public Folder**
- [x] Create subfolders such as "public/assets/" and "public/images/" to organize images, fonts, and icons.

Each task will be checked off as Code Mode completes them.
