## TDD Approach & Testing Instructions
For each homepage component, write the corresponding unit tests BEFORE writing the component code. After the tests are defined, implement the component code and run the tests to ensure they pass. Do not proceed to the next section until tests for the current component pass successfully and receive approval.

## Homepage Component Implementation Comprehensive Checklist (Detailed with TDD, Testing Plan, and Copy Details)

This checklist is based explicitly on the content from docs/copywriting/homepage.md to ensure all textual and stylistic details are captured in the implementation and testing of each section.
