## Current Session Context
**Date:** 2025-02-19

This session focused on establishing the project directory structure for the AI Talent Marketplace Platform, with particular emphasis on the marketing site phase while planning for future app development.

## Recent Changes
- Created comprehensive directory structure for both marketing site and future app development
- Established src/app/marketing/ for marketing pages and src/app/app/ for future app features
- Set up mock data structure with dummy talent and jobs data
- Created testing directory structure for unit, integration, and e2e tests
- Organized static assets in public/assets/ and public/images/
- Updated functional_specifications.md with detailed technical implementation plans
- Decided to maintain clear separation between business (projectBrief.md) and technical (functional_specifications.md) documentation

## Current Goals
- Begin implementation of marketing site pages
- Set up initial test framework
- Implement mock API endpoints for talent and job data

## Open Questions
- Will we need additional mock data beyond talent and jobs?
- Should we start setting up the waitlist functionality early in the development process?
