## Current Session Context

**Date:** 2/19/2025

**Session Summary:**
- Finalized the homepage plan and comprehensive TDD-based implementation checklist in .cline-tasks.md.
- Established a TDD approach: write unit tests before code, then implement and verify tests, and await user approval before proceeding.
- Implemented proper component organization structure:
  - Created marketing/homepage and app component directories
  - Established clear separation between marketing and app components
  - Updated functional specifications to reflect the new structure
- Completed first homepage section (HeroSection):
  - Created and organized test files in tests/unit/marketing/homepage/
  - Implemented HeroSection component with all required content and styling
  - Followed TDD approach with comprehensive test coverage

**Current Progress:**
- ✅ Task 1: Created homepage component directory with proper organization
- ✅ Task 2.1: Written unit tests for HeroSection
- ✅ Task 2: Implemented HeroSection component
- Next: Task 3: Implement PainPointsSection

**Key Decisions:**
1. Component Organization:
   - Marketing components in src/components/marketing/
   - App components in src/components/app/
   - Clear separation for maintainability and scalability
2. Test Organization:
   - Marketing tests in tests/unit/marketing/
   - Mirrors component structure for clarity
3. Documentation:
   - Updated functional specifications with detailed component organization
   - Maintained clear separation between marketing and app concerns

**Next Steps:**
- Proceed with PainPointsSection implementation following the same TDD approach
- Continue to maintain clear separation between marketing and app components
- Ensure all new components follow established organization pattern

**Notes:**
- All components should maintain consistent styling as per style guide
- Continue following TDD approach for remaining sections
- Keep functional specifications updated as architecture evolves
