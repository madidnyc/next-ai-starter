## Current Session Context

**Date:** 2/19/2025

**Session Summary:**
- Finalized the homepage plan and comprehensive TDD-based implementation checklist in .cline-tasks.md.
- Established a TDD approach: write unit tests before code, then implement and verify tests, and await user approval before proceeding.
- Updated task instructions include detailed commit steps after each section implementation.

**Next Steps:**
- Proceed to implement each homepage section in code mode following the checklist.
- After each section is implemented and tests pass, commit the changes.
- **Git Instructions:**
  - Run: <code>git add . && git commit -m "chore: update homepage implementation tasks and memory bank"</code>
  - Then push the changes with: <code>git push</code>
- Ensure all pending changes are validated by tests before pushing.

**Notes:**
- All asset placeholders and testing outcomes should be reviewed prior to the final commit and push.
